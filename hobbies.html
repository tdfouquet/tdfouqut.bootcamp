    <p class="start">One of my favorite hobbies besides playing video games is frisbee golfing!</p>
    <p class="what">Frisbee Golfing (frolfing for short), or disc golf, is a great way to experience the outdoors! It is golfing but with a frisbee instead. The rules are the same as golf, and instead of a hole it's a basket. A lot of the courses are in wooded area's for more difficulties.</p>
    <p class="feel">It is a great way to relieve stress, and anger. Cause sometimes you just gotta throw something.</p>
    <p class="link">This website is a great place to learn more, and get a better understanding of disc golf!<a class="site" href="https://www.discgolf.com/what-is-disc-golf/#"> disc golf</a></p>
